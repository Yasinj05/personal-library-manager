# Personal Library Manager API üìö

The Personal Library Manager API facilitates the management of a personal library, allowing users to manage books and authors through a RESTful interface. This application provides endpoints for CRUD operations on books and authors, making it easy to store, retrieve, update, and delete library data.

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you need to install the software:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB

### Installing üì•

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-library-manager.git
   ```

2. **Go to the project directory:**

   ```
   cd personal-library-manager
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add:

   ```
   PORT=3000
